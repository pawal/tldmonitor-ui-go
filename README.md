# TLDMonitor Go-UI

This is a rewritten UI for the [TLDMonitor website](https://tldmonitor.blipp.com/), written in the Go programming language. It has almost exactly the same functionality and design as the [old software written in Perl](https://github.com/pawal/zonemaster-collector/tree/master/TLDMonitor).
